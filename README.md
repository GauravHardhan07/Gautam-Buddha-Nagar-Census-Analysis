This Excel Project analyzes Gautam Buddha Nagar’s census data across blocks, towns, and villages—highlighting population, literacy, workforce, and caste metrics to uncover rural-urban gaps and guide inclusive development planning.

## Project Objective
To analyze and visualize key demographic, literacy, and workforce patterns across blocks, towns, and villages of Gautam Buddha Nagar district, highlighting rural-urban disparities and social inclusion indicators for policy, planning, and public service delivery.


## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| 🧍‍♂️ Total Population Split                   | By Block, Town, Village; segmented by gender | 
| 🎓 Literacy Rate by Gender & Area           | % Literate = (Total Literates / Total Population) × 100 |

| 🎯 Female Literacy & Employment Index       | Measures gender development (literacy & jobs ratio) | 
| 🧬 Scheduled Castes/Tribes Composition      | Share of SC/ST population area-wise | 
| 🌍 Urbanization Rate                        | Town population vs village population (% contribution) | 
| 🔍 Dependency Ratio (optional)              | Non-working population / working population | 

## Project Insights
